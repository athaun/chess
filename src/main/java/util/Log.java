 * Logging utility to print colored and labeled errors with class references.

 * - FATAL -> only fatal errors and major problems are reported; this is the minimal setting <br>
 * - WARNINGS -> includes fatal errors and minor warnings; useful for detecting common issues <br>
 * - NO_DEBUG -> displays all information except for hard debug logs; for integrity checks <br>
 * - ALL -> shows all logs including hard debug for a detailed overview over vital systems <br>
